# ClaimCheck Daily v3 — Current Specification

**Course:** Grad5900 — Agentic AI  
**Author:** Bharani Rajendran  
**Repo:** https://github.com/bharanirajendran-blip/ClaimCheck_Daily_v3

## 1. Overview

ClaimCheck Daily v3 is the current development branch of the ClaimCheck project. The code currently implements the `v2` fact-checking runtime and adds an MCP server interface for manual claim checks and archive lookup.

Implemented now:
- LangGraph fact-checking pipeline
- persistent evidence store
- hybrid retrieval with TF-IDF + BM25
- lightweight graph context using source-domain links
- GPT-4o verdict generation
- GPT-4o LLM-as-a-Judge verification
- self-correcting retry loop
- low-confidence review gate with persisted review queue
- MCP server with `check_claim`, `search_evidence`, and `get_verdict_history`

Planned but not yet integrated into the runtime graph:
- supervisor/specialist multi-agent routing
- debate or reflection nodes
- richer human-in-the-loop interrupts and approval flow
- persistent vector memory
- checkpointing

## 2. Implemented Architecture

### Director (`agent/director.py`)
- Selects the top claims from harvested candidates
- Synthesizes verdicts grounded in retrieved evidence
- Builds the final `DailyReport`

### Researcher (`agent/researcher.py`)
- Investigates one claim at a time
- Uses a ReAct-style tool loop with `fetch_url`
- Stores fetched page content for downstream chunking
- Supports targeted corroboration during retry

### fetch_url tool (`agent/tools.py`)
- Fetches a URL with `httpx`
- Strips HTML to plain text with BeautifulSoup
- Returns bounded page text for LLM consumption

### Evidence Store (`agent/store.py`)
- Persists `raw_source`, `summary`, and `source_metadata` chunks
- Writes daily and cumulative JSON artifacts
- Deduplicates chunks by `chunk_id`

### Knowledge Graph (`agent/graph.py`)
- Tracks relationships between claims and source domains
- Adds lightweight cross-run context to retrieval queries

### HybridRetriever (`agent/retriever.py`)
- Uses two channels:
  - TF-IDF cosine similarity
  - BM25 keyword scoring
- Applies chunk-type weighting and claim-local boosts
- Merges claim-local hits first, then cross-run fallback hits

### Verifier (`agent/verifier.py`)
- Scores verdicts on groundedness, citation quality, contradiction, and assumption
- Triggers retries when groundedness or citation quality is weak

### Review Queue (`agent/review_queue.py`)
- Persists pending human-review tasks for low-confidence claims
- Writes `review_queue.json` into the current outputs directory
- Lets published artifacts mark claims as `PENDING_REVIEW`

### Publisher (`agent/publisher.py`)
- Writes HTML reports to `docs/` or `docs_manual/`
- Writes JSON reports to `outputs/` or `outputs_manual/`

### MCP Server (`agent/mcp_server.py`)
- Exposes the pipeline through MCP
- Supports:
  - `check_claim(text)`
  - `search_evidence(query, k=5)`
  - `get_verdict_history(date=None)`
- Manual MCP checks use `docs_manual/` and `outputs_manual/`
- Read tools aggregate both daily and manual artifacts

## 3. Runtime Flow

The compiled LangGraph currently uses this sequence:

```text
START
  │
  ▼
harvest
  │
  ▼
select
  │
  ▼
research
  │
  ▼
store_evidence
  │
  ▼
graph_context
  │
  ▼
retrieve
  │
  ▼
verdict
  │
  ▼
verify
  │
  ├── retry? ──► revise_query ──► retrieve
  │
  └── pass ──► review_gate ──► publish ──► END
```

This is still the `v2` runtime. The MCP server invokes this flow for manual single-claim checks.

## 4. Data Models

All shared models are defined in `agent/models.py`.

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Claim` | One harvested or manual claim |
| `ResearchResult` | Research findings plus source metadata and fetched pages |
| `EvidenceChunk` | One persisted chunk of evidence |
| `RetrievalHit` | One ranked retrieval result |
| `Verdict` | Final verdict label, confidence, summary, and key evidence |
| `VerifierReport` | LLM judge rubric output |
| `DailyReport` | Final report for one run |
| `PipelineState` | LangGraph shared state |

## 6. Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` | Claude research agent |
| `openai` | GPT-4o director and verifier |
| `mcp` | MCP server runtime |
| `langgraph` | Workflow orchestration |
| `pydantic` | Data validation |
| `scikit-learn` + `numpy` | Hybrid retrieval |
| `networkx` | Graph context |
| `feedparser` | RSS/Atom ingestion |
| `httpx` + `beautifulsoup4` | Fetch and strip article content |
| `python-dotenv` + `pyyaml` | Configuration loading |

## 7. Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bharanirajendran-blip/ClaimCheck_Daily_v3.git
cd ClaimCheck_Daily_v3
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY

python run.py --dry-run
python run.py
python run.py --claim "Apollo 11 landed on the Moon in 1969."
python -m agent.mcp_server
```

## 8. Known Limitations

- The runtime graph does not yet include week 10 multi-agent nodes or the full week 11 HITL/memory design.
- The runtime graph now includes a simple review gate, but it does not yet pause execution or support reviewer approvals inside the graph.
- Retrieval is still the existing TF-IDF + BM25 implementation, not ChromaDB or embedding-based vector memory.
- The graph is still source-domain-centric rather than a richer entity/event GraphRAG design.
- Retry loops re-run downstream verdict/verify work for the whole selected batch rather than only the failing claim.
- Feed headlines are used as claim text and may be imprecise.

## 9. Current Roadmap

The next major implementation milestones for this branch are:

1. Add a real week 10 orchestration layer to the LangGraph runtime.
2. Add week 11 confidence routing and human review checkpoints.
3. Add a real memory layer only after the runtime flow is updated to use it.
